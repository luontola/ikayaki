% EXAMPLE:

\beginClass{RunQueue}
\classComment{
	Executes Runnable objects in a private worker thread after a pre-defined delay. The worker thread will terminate automatically when there are no runnables to be executed. Optionally executes only the last inserted runnable. All operations are thread-safe.

	This class can be used for example in connection with a "continuous search" invoked by a series of GUI events (such as a DocumentListener), but it is necessary to react to only the last event after a short period of user inactivity.

	Inserts a Runnable object to the end of the queue. It will remain there until it is executed or another object replaces it. If execOnlyLast is set to true, the queue will be cleared before inserting this runnable to it. If there is no worker thread running, a new one will be spawned.
