\section{Introduction}

This document describes client requirements and system 
requirements for a SQUID magnetometer program that will be designed and 
implemeted as a software engineering student project at University of 
Helsinki at the Computer Science Department. The client is the Department 
of Geophysics.

This document serves as a contract between client and us..

\subsection{Use cases}

Squid Use Cases, preliminary list with no explanations nor scenarios.

\subsubsection{General measuring}

\begin{itemize}
\item Do single step measuring without demagnetization
\item Do single step measuring with demagnetization
\item Do automatic demagnetization-measuring sequence
\item Do thellier measuring
\item Do thermal measuring
\item Measure magnetometer ground noise
\item Measure empty sample holder noise
\item Fully manual measuring
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Move sample handler to desired position
  \item Rotate sample handler to desired angle
  \item Measure in current position
  \item Demagnetize in current position
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{File formats}

\begin{itemize}
\item Automatically save all measurement cycles in .dat? file
\item Save standard sample measurement results in .std file
\item Export (thellier) results into .tdt file
\item Export single measurement details into .srm file
\item Print measurement results
\item Print graph sheet (with 7 different graphs; described elsewhere x)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Functionality}

\begin{itemize}
\item Load .dat? file
\item Append measurement results to .dat? file
\item Create new .dat? file (project?)
\item Insert AF sequence with start-step-stop values
\item Load AF sequence
\item Save AF sequence
\item Edit AF sequence on-the-fly
\item Pause AF sequence
\item Panic abort operation instantly
\end{itemize}
