\section{Introduction}

This document describes client requirements and system 
requirements for a SQUID magnetometer program that will be designed and 
implemeted as a software engineering student project at University of 
Helsinki at the Computer Science Department. The client is the Department 
of Geophysics.

This document serves as a contract between client and us..

\subsection{Environment}

The computer that will run this program will be equal or better to 1GHz CPU, 
256MB RAM, 1280x1024 resolution. The program must run under Windows XP. The 
hardware and communication with it is described in the section "External 
interfaces".

\subsection{Maintainability}

It must be possible to continue the development of the program. The 
documentation must be complete so that other teams can quickly continue the 
development even if they have not studied user interface designing. It must be 
possible to add new graph types to the program and export the measurement data 
to other programs.


\subsection{Restrictions}

Program will be used in normal PC which is connected to magnetometer. 
Taking into account rapid phase of computer evolution it is possible 
that computer in which program is used can change, accordingly the 
program should be able to be installed by outsiders. 
We need not prepare to changing of magnetometer, as new 
magnenetometer will probably have its own program.

\section{Architecture overview}

The program architecture can be divided into three parts: SQUID interface, 
measurement project and user interface. The program will also communicate with 
the SQUID hardware and local file system. A graphical representation of the 
architecture can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{architecture.eps}
\caption{Architecture overview}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

SQUID interface is responsible for controlling the hardware in an orderly 
manner. It will provide high- and low-level controls for using the hardware. 
Communication with the hardware is done via COM ports. The SQUID interface will 
hide the protocol-level commands from the programmer and prevent illegal use of 
the hardware.

Measurement project is responsible for managing the project information, 
measurement sequence and measurement data. It will recieve commands from the 
user interface and notify the UI when the state of the project changes. It will 
send commands to the SQUID interface, recieve measurement data and save it. When 
the internal data of the project changes, the copy on the local file system will 
be automatically synchronized after a short delay (1 second or less).

User interface is responsible for communicating with the user of the program. It 
will update itself whenever the state of the measurement project is changed. It 
will send commands from the user to the program.



\section{External interfaces}

Interfaces to existing software and hardware are described here.

\subsection{Existing program}

The existing software for using the SQUID is "2G Enterprises Data Acquisition". 
We have access to the source code for version 2.99.3 of the program. From the 
old source code we will reuse basically only the SerialIO component. We will 
build an interface for communicating with the SQUID hardware by using Java and 
JNI (Java Native Interface).

\subsection{Hardware control protocols}

The SQUID consists of three independent units:

\begin{itemize}
\item Automated Sample Handler System (MODEL 2G800)
\item Automatic Sample Degaussing System (MODEL 2G600)
\item Superconducting Rock Magnetometer (MODEL 755R or 760R)
\end{itemize}

Automated Sample Handler System controls the movement and rotation of the sample 
holder. Its protocol is described in Appendix 1.

Automatic Sample Degaussing System controls the demagnetizer. Its protocol is 
described in Appendix 2.

Superconducting Rock Magnetometer reads the measurements from the magnetometer. 
Its protocol is described in Appendix 3.



\section{Validation}

Description of how to validate the set requirements.
