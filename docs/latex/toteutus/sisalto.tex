\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This document describes the changes from design to production (section~\ref{sec:changes}), improvement suggestions for the program (section~\ref{sec:improv}), as well as a TODO-list based on comments in source code (section~\ref{sec:todo}).

\section{Changes from Design document}
\label{sec:changes}

Here we describe how the implementation/production of the software differs from that planned in Design document.


\subsection{Data classes}

Data classes are in packages ikayaki, ikayaki.squid and ikayaki.util.

Package ikayaki holds generic data classes, ikayaki.squid holds classes loosely related to the squid interface, and ikayaki.util has utilities.


\subsubsection{Project data}

\insertdia{project-graph}

Responsible for holding all the measurement data and controlling the SQUID. All of these classes were produced according to plans and there were no significant changes. Things such as susceptibility and some other data from the measurements was added. The way that the mathematical calculations are made, had some changes, such as the holder and background noise corrections.


\subsubsection{Squid interface}

\insertdia{squid-graph}

Squid Interface offers the Project class an interface to safely control the SQUID magnetometer. The Squid class holds three classes that handle communication to to three separate parts of the SQUID (Handler, Degausser and Magnetometer).

Classes are Squid, Handler, Magnetometer, Degausser.

These were not desinged well because it was hard to know how exactly we should use Squid at the time. Lots of changes were made and many methods were removed and added. Private status String is not used in any class and messageBuffer is not used like vise. Messages are catch on private SynchronousQueue<String> answerQueue = new SynchronousQueue<String>() variable and there is private boolean waitingForMessage variable indicating are we waiting any message from equipment.

\textbf{Handler}: Biggest change here is that we use WorkingQueue here. And EstimatedMovement are calculated here too. Many of the methods are change and most are removed or not used like planned.

\textbf{Methods not used or removed}:

poll(take)Message()

setPositionRegister(int r)

setPosition(int p)

setSteps(int s)

stop()

setBaseSpeed(int b)

setHoldTime(int h)

setCrystalFrequence(int cf)

getStatus()

\textbf{Methods added or modified}:

public int getEstimatedPosition() : return where is handler.

public int getEstimatedRotation() : return rotation of handler.

public boolean isMoving() : tells if we are moving.

public boolean isRotating() : tells if we are rotating.

public void moveToLeftLimit() : starts moving to left limit.

public void moveToRightLimit() : starts moving to right limit.

protected void moveSteps(int steps, int velocity) throws SerialIOException : moves steps as commanded.

protected void moveToPosition(int position) throws SerialIOException : moves handler to position, relative to home.

protected void seekHome() throws SerialIOException : seeks home position.

protected void selectMovement() throws SerialIOException : sets Handler on moving phase.

protected void selectRotation() throws SerialIOException : sets Handler on rotating phase.

protected void setPosition(int position) : sets position for EstimatedMovement.

protected void setRotation(int rotationSteps) : sets  rotation for EstimatedMovement.

protected void setUp() : sets Handler online.

protected void slewToLimit(boolean toRight) throws SerialIOException : sets Handler to go limit.

\textbf{Degausser}: Pretty much the same as planned. There is added blockingWrite(String command) that waits that command is sended, which is known when degausser answers it back.

\textbf{Magnetometer}: Pretty much the same but getter commands are not used.

\subsubsection{Squid emulator}

Squid Emulator is separate from the rest of the program and it is used only for testing that the Squid Interface works correctly. Biggest change was that this wasnt developed much and its not working as planned. Mainly was used to test that commands are sended correctly and Squid Interface gets answers.


\subsubsection{Serial communication}

SerialIO and classes related to it takes care of the harware layer of serial communication. Using these classes the program communicates with the Degausser, Samplehandler and Magnetometer. SerialIO represents one serial port and when it's created it reserves the port to itself. SerialProperties class includes all the configuration data for the serial port.


\subsubsection{Global settings}

Global properties that are used all around the program. There were many properties added to the Settings class. Not all of the methods are documented, so that should be done. All methods were converted to be static.


\subsubsection{Utilities}

Utility classes that are used in the program, but do not fit any of the other packages. There were a couple of classes added to the ikayaki.util package. The new classes are ComponentPrinter for printing, DocumentUtilities for reading and writing XML, LoggerPrintStream for adding timestamps to System.err and copying the output to a file, SerialProxy for monitoring the communication between two serial ports (use virtual serial ports to redirect the old program's communication through SerialProxy this way: Program -> Virtual COM -> SerialProxy -> Real COM -> SQUID Hardware).


\subsection{GUI classes}

This section is divided into subsections by gui components, each of which has one or more classes.

All gui classes are in package ikayaki.gui.


\subsubsection{Generic GUI components}

There were no changes to ProjectComponent.


\subsubsection{Main window}

\insertdia{main-view-panel-graph}

Basically the same as was designed, but there were many methods added.


\subsubsection{Configuration window}

Separate window which is opened from menubar and it updates settings for Squid interface. Used usually only when system is installed to setup it. If there is something changed, program should be restarted as there is no quarantee that they affect directly.


\subsubsection{Project Explorer}

Nothing much here; some internal private field renames. Oh and a lot more stuff than planning suggests :)

ProjectExplorerTable is now its own class (as Calibration uses it too), and ProjectExplorerPopupMenu is its inner class. Also has inner class ProjectExplorerTableModel, which, unlike normally (as in the standard way), is quite empty and most of the stuff is in ProjectExplorerTable. Uses StyledWrapper for table row background colors (and Calibration boldface-reminder).

NewProjectPanel is inner class of ProjectExplorerPanel.


\subsubsection{Calibration}

Uses ProjectExplorerTable, which makes CalibrationPanel.java really short.


\subsubsection{Project information}

Contains and allows the editing of the basic information of a sample. All plans were dumped and the classes were programmed XP-style.


\subsubsection{Sequence and measurement data}

Contains and allows the editing of the measurement sequence. All plans were dumped and the classes were programmed XP-style.


\subsubsection{Measurement details}

Contains the details of the selected row in the measurement sequence. All plans were dumped and the classes were programmed XP-style.


\subsubsection{Measurement controls}

Sadly, ManualControlsPanel had to go into MagnetometerStatusPanel as an inner class, since they share some data and move-radiobuttons.

MagnetometerStatusPanel's updateStatus takes no parameters, as it asks position and rotation directly from Handler. Also, status image is updated at all times once in 50 ms (positions asked with getEstimatedPosition and getEstimatedRotation in Handler).

Here too, a lot more stuff than what planning imply.

ManualControlsPanel's manual control components are disabled whenever there's \textit{any} Squid action, to keep those fragile equipments from messing up.


\subsubsection{Graphs}

Graph panels visualize the measurement data. MeasurementGraphsPanel listens to MeasurementEvents to update the measurement data in plots. AbstractPlot is an abstract class which implements all the general features of graph plots. IntensityPlot and StereoPlot extend the functionality of AbstractPlot and implement their special drawing features accordingly.


\section{Improvement suggestions}
\label{sec:improv}

What's left for the program to make it perfect :)


\subsection{Adding more calculations}

The algorithms for the measurement's mathematical calculations are spead around the program code in a perverted way. Look for these places when you want to change or add something:

- Magnetometer.readData() reads the raw measurement data from the SQUID. \\
- Project.Measurement.run() contains the routine for a measurement step. Project.ManualMeasure.run() is the same for manual measurements. \\
- MeasurementStep.addResult(MeasurementResult) adds the measurement data to a step, and gets the holder calibration from the Settings class when necessary. \\
- Project.updateTransforms() contains the transformation matrices for rotating the sample from sample coordinates to geographic coordinates. \\
- MeasurementStep.updateTransforms() applies the fixes and transformations to all of the MeasurementResult objects. \\
- MeasurementResult.applyFixes(MeasurementStep) rotates the sample to 0 angle and applies noise, +/-Z and sample holder fixes. This is the sampleVector. \\
- MeasurementResult.setTransform(Matrix3d) applies the transformation matrix for rotating the sample coordinates to geographic coordinates. This is the geographicVector. \\
- MeasurementValue classes contain the algorithms for calculating all kinds of mathematical numbers. \\
- SequenceColumn classes contain the information that how those numbers should be shown in the MeasurementSequenceTable. New columns are added to the table by listing them in SequenceColumn.getAllColumns(). Default columns are defined in Settings.getDefaultColumns().


\subsection{Porting to Linux}

There are a couple of things that need to be taken care of, if the program is ever ported to Linux or some other OS:

- Maximizing the program window (in Ikayaki's constructor) requires some native code, because Java does not have a way for doing it. \\
- Opening the user manual from the Help menu needs some OS-specific instructions to open the web browser. \\
- Serial communication will at least require the OS-specific version of javax.comm, or maybe it needs to be done in some another way. \\
- Export-popup-menu (ProjectExplorerPopupMenu in ProjectExplorerPanel) uses new File("A:/") for disk drive.


\subsection{Warning Signal for Degausser}

As mentioned in the requirements document, the client wants that the program will make an alarm signal, if the degausser for some reason does not ramp down in time. The protocol specifications of the degausser says that it will automatically prevent that from happening, so this feature was dumped because there was no easy way to do it and it seemed unnecessary because of the hardware specifications.

Apparently Matti Leino has made such a system previously, so try to find out more from him.

Quote from Lauri Pesonen:

\textit{Siit‰ ambulanssivaroitussignaalista jos ramp down ei tapahdu.}

\textit{Matti leino odottaa vieti‰ "done" noin 1 minnutin. Jos k‰sky‰ ei tule niin kelojen virtaan ERIKSEEN asennettu mikrokytkin kytkee virran pois jotta kelat eiv‰t pala. T‰m‰n voitte kertoa raportsissa mutta varsinainen homma tehd‰‰n syksyll‰ uuden ryhm‰n kanssa. Eli nyt tuskin ehditte mutta n‰in se on tehty. Soittakaa Matti Leino 0 205 50 2272 (GTK) ja h‰n kuvaa kuinka h‰n teki. Olisi t‰rke‰t‰ ett‰ kirjaatte kuitenkin tuon Matti Leinon tekniikan ylˆs!}
