\subsection{squid/SquidEmulator.java}
            No further development needed. Was only little help on testing and wad dumped soon after testing in laboratorium.

\subsection{squid/SquidFront.java}
	No further development needed. Have been used for testing some commands, but human control is too risky as we noticed.
