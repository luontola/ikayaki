\subsection{gui/ProjectExplorerPanel.java}

Cycling through popup menu list with up/down keys changes directory; it shouldn't, but can't recognize those changed-events from mouse clicks.

When mouseclicking autocomplete list item, textfield gets cleared because of \texttt{setBrowserFieldPopup(...)}; no easy way around this, as other ways tried cause more other problems.

Many problems here arise from the fact that JComboBox isn't designed for recklessly changing popup menu contents (as we swap between directory history and autocomplete results). It might have been better to make an own component here, instead of using JComboBox, as now the whole thing has a lot of bubblegun stitching. But, it's good enough now.


\subsection{gui/ProjectExplorerTable.java}

Table columns have no indication for sort column, as Esko didn't like the "*" :)
	    
ProjectExplorerPopupMenu uses new File("A:/") for disk drive; should be changed for any linux/etc porting.

SRM export is commented out, as it's not supported (in Project).

There are no messages telling if exporting was succesful or not (as I didn't want any popups for it)... Also, exporting overwrites any previous files with the same name; this might be just what the user wants, but it could also cause an unhappy surprise.

\subsection{squid/SquidEmulator.java}
            No further development needed. Was only little help on testing and wad dumped soon after testing in laboratorium.

\subsection{squid/SquidFront.java}
	No further development needed. Have been used for testing some commands, but human control is too risky as we noticed.
