To install comm-api to your java runtime environment you need copy three (3) files:

squid/lib/win32com.dll

this file needs to be installed in 'JRE/bin'-folder.

squid/lib/comm.jar

this file needs to be installed in 'JRE/lib'-folder and needs to be added in classpath
set JRE/lib/comm.jar;%CLASSPATH%

squid/lib/javax.comm.properties

this file needs to be installed in 'JRE/lib'-folder.

tricky part is to find you JRE-folder. It might be something like this:
C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_02
or
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_01\jre
