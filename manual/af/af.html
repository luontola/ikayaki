<h1>AF Measurement</h1>

This help explains how AF-project is created and how measurement sequence is performed. 

<h2>Calibrating</h2>

<img src="af1.png" alt="Start up">

<p>Usually if calibration hasn't been done recently, you need to calibrate. If calibration has been done within 24 hours you don't normally need to calibrate and can jump to next segment. If calibration       hasn't been done recently Choose <code>Holder Noise</code> from calibration list. Make sure that sample holder is empty, move it to home with manual controls, if it is not already there to check.</p>

<img src="af2.png" alt="Holder noise calibration">

<p>Click <code>Calibrate</code>-button. Wait until measurement is finished</p>

<img src="af3.png" alt="Holder noise calibration done">

<p>Move sample holder to home. Choose <code>Standard Sample</code> from calibration list. Put standard sample into holder. Click <code>Calibrate</code>-button. Wait until measurement is finished. Move sample holder to home. Take standard sample out of holder.</p>

<p>More about calibration in <a href="../calibration/calibration.html">Calibration</a>.</p>

<h2>Creating new AF-project</h2>

<img src="af6.png" alt="Creating new project">

<p>Write projects name into field at the bottom of project explorer. Make sure that <b>AF</b> is selected(shown) in drop down menu. Click <code>Create New</code>-button. New project is added to project explorers list and selected.</p>

<p>More info about project explorer in <a href="../explorer/project_explorer.html">Project Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2>Inserting data</h2>

<img src="af5.png" alt="Empty project information">

<p>Put into operator-field your name. Date-field is automatically filled, but it can be changed as desired. Choose Auto-radio button. Put into Area-field area from where sample was taken and to Site-field site. Choose Hand or Core -radio button, according to samples type. Write into Rock type-field samples rock type. Write into Latitude and Longitude -fields samples latitude and longitude. Write into Strike and Dip -fields samples strike and dip. Write into Volume and Mass -fields samples volume and mass. Write samples susceptibility into susceptibility field. Choose Volume-radio button. Write any comments you want.</p>

<img src="af6.png" alt="Filled project information">

<p>It is not necessary to insert any data on these fields before measuring. Measurements are recalculated after any change to relevant fields in project measurement.</p>

<p>More info about project infomation in <a href="../information/project_information.html">Project Information</a>.</p>

<h2>Adding sequence</h2>

<img src="af7.png" alt="Selecting sequence">

<p>Choose correct measurement sequence for sample from drop down menu. Sequence is added to measurement sequence table.</p>

<img src="af8.png" alt="Sequene added">

<p>More about measurement sequence in <a href="../sequence/sequence_panel.html">Sequence panel</a>.</p>

<h2>Measuring</h2>

<img src="af10.png" alt="Ready for measuring">

<p>Put sample into sample holder. Click <code>Measure</code>-button. Magnetometer starts measuring and demagnetizing.</p>

<img src="af11.png" alt="Measurement in progress">
 
<p>Wait until measurement sequence is finished. Move sample holder to home. Take sample out of holder.</p>

<img src="af12.png" alt="Measurement done">
