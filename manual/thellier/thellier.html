<h1>Thellier measurement</h1>

This help explains how Thellier-project is created and how measurement is performed. 

<h2>Calibrating</h2>

<comment>TODO: add image about calibration here.</comment>

<p>Usually if calibration hasn't been done recently, you need to calibrate. If calibration has been done within 24 hours you don't normally need to calibrate and can jump to next segment. If calibration       hasn't been done recently Choose <code>Holder Noise</code> from calibration list. Make sure that sample holder is empty, move it to home with manual controls, if it is not already there to check.</p>

<comment>TODO: add image about manual controls here.</comment>

<p>Click <code>Calibrate</code>-button. Wait until measurement is finished</p>

<comment>TODO: add image about finished holder noise calibration here.</comment>

<p>Move sample holder to home. Choose <code>Standard Sample</code> from calibration list. Put standard sample into holder. Click <code>Calibrate</code>-button. Wait until measurement is finished. Move sample holder to home. Take standard sample out of holder.</p>

<p>More about calibration in <a href="../calibration/calibration.html">Calibration</a>.</p>

<h2>Creating new Thellier-project</h2>

<comment>TODO: add image of project explorer here (new project textfield circled).</comment>

<p>Write projects name into field at the bottom of project explorer. Select <b>Thellier</b> from drop down menu. Click <code>Create New</code>-button. New project is added to project explorers list and selected.</p>

<p>More info about project explorer in <a href="../explorer/project_explorer.html">Project Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2>Inserting data</h2>

<comment>TODO: add image of project information of new project here.</comment>

<p>Put into operator-field your name. Date-field is automatically filled, but it can be changed as desired. Choose Auto-radio button. Put into Area-field area from where sample was taken and to Site-field site. Choose Hand or Core -radio button, according to samples type. Write into Rock type-field samples rock type. Write into Latitude and Longitude -fields samples latitude and longitude. Write into Strike and Dip -fields samples strike and dip. Write into Volume and Mass -fields samples volume and mass. Write samples susceptibility into susceptibility field. Choose Volume-radio button. Write any comments you want.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to insert any data on these fields before measuring. Measurements are recalculated after any change to relevant fields in project measurement.</p>

<p>More info about project infomation in <a href="../information/project_information.html">Project Information</a>.</p>

<h2>Adding sequence</h2>

<comment>TODO: add image of empty measurement sequence with first row selected.</comment>

<p>Select first row and column from measurement sequence table and enter temperature used to demagnetize sample and press enter. Use 0 if sample wasn't heated.</p>

<p>More about measurement sequence in <a href="../sequence/sequence_panel.html">Sequence panel</a>.</p>

<h2>Measuring</h2>

<comment>TODO: add image of controls here.</comment>

<p>Put sample into sample holder. Click <code>Single Step</code>-button. Magnetometer starts measuring and demagnetizing.</p>

<comment>TODO: add image of whole program in middle of measurement here.</comment>
 
<p>Wait until measurement is finished. Move sample holder to home. Take sample out of holder.</p>
