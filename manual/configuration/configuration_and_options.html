<h1>Configuration and options</h1>

<h2>Squid Device Configuration</h2>

WARNING: this configuration should be only used by squid maintaince team who know what they are doing. These values should be set only when system is installed or changes are made to System. <br>

<h3> Magnetometer </h3>

COM-port: serial port which Magnetometer is connected. Should be different than Handler, but can be same as Degausser.<br>
<br>
Calibration constants: These values are important for getting right values from magnetometer. Accepts values in maximum of 12 decimals.<br>
<br>

<h3> Degausser </h3>

COM-port: serial port which Degausser is connected. Should be different than Handler, but can be same as Magnetometer.<br>
<br>
Maximum field: This value is maximum field value, in mT, Degausser can go. Minimum is always 1.1 mT. Be careful not to put too big value here as it can damage equipment. Maximum value is 300mT.<br>
<br>
Ramp: This tells how fast Degausser ramps up the field. This can be set higher if needed.<br>
<br>
Delay: Ramp delay.<br>
<br>

<h3 Handler </h3>

COM-port: serial port which Handler is connected. Should be different than Magnetometer and Degausser.<br>
<br>
Acceleration: Indicates how fast Handler accelerates to its velocity. Value is between 0...127.<br>
<br>
Deceleration: Indicates how fast Handler decelerates from its velocity. Value is between 0...127.<br>
<br>
Velocity: Maximum velocity handler moves. Value is between 50...8500<br>
<br>
Velocity Meas.: Maximum velocity in Magnetometer handler moves, should be small. Value is between 50...8500<br>
<br>
Transverse Y AF: Position relative to home where is Degausser Y coil (X is demagnetized there too). Value in steps.<br>
<br>
Axial AF: Position relative to home where is Degausser Z coil. Value in steps.<br>
<br>
Sample Load: Position relative to home where is sample load position. Value in steps.<br>
<br>
Background: Position relative to home where Handler is when Magnetometer measures background. Value in steps.<br>
<br>
Measurement: Position relative to home where Handler is when Magnetometer measures sample . Value in steps.<br>
<br>
Rotation Velocity: Indicates how fast Handlers rotation accelerates to its velocity. Value is between 0...127.<br>
<br>
Rotation Acc.: Indicates how fast Handlers rotation accelerates to its velocity. Value is between 0...127.<br>
<br>
Rotation Dec.: Indicates how fast Handlers rotation decelerates from its velocity. Value is between 0...127.<br>
<br>
Rotation counts: Tells how many steps is one full round (360 degree). Can be negative when direction is changed.<br>
